### Arriving at Work

I woke up this morning and thought, “TGIF!” I have been looking forward to the weekend and all I need to do is to get through one more day of work. I drive to work and pull into the parking lot next to my office building. I stop at the security gate. I put my key card into the card reader and the security arm goes up. I drive into the parking structure and find a parking spot. I make sure that my parking permit is showing in the windshield and I lock up. I get my briefcase out of the back seat and walk toward the building. It’s a short walk and I’m there in no time. When I get there, I take out my badge and put it around my neck before I go through the main entrance of the building. Employees are supposed to wear their badges at all times at work so that the security guards know that we belong there. One day last week, I forgot my badge at home and I had to get a visitor’s pass for the day. My coworker made fun of me all day. He kept asking me if he could get me some coffee and when I was leaving. What a joker!

### Checking Mail, Email, and Voicemail

The first thing I do when I get to work each morning is to check my inboxes. I go to the mailroom to check my mail slot to see what mail has arrived overnight. There are always a lot of intra-office and inter-office letters and memos. Much of it is junk mail, so I spend a few minutes sorting through it. The next thing I do is to turn on my computer to check email. I open my email program and my new messages automatically download into my inbox. Even though I have a pretty good spam filter, I still check through my trash folder carefully to make sure nothing important was filtered out. We’re also not supposed to get personal emails at work, but sometimes my friends send or forward me messages to this address and I have to make sure I respond using my personal email address. When I don’t have time to finish a message or when I get interrupted, I save it into my draft folder.
Finally, I check my voicemail. I call the voicemail system and enter in my PIN to bypass the outgoing message. I have two new messages, and after listening to them, I save one of them and delete the other. I look at the clock and it’s already 9:30 AM! It’s time for the morning meeting.

### Attending the Morning Meeting

I arrive at the conference room right before the meeting starts, and sit down in a chair around the large conference table. Our manager passes out a handout of the meeting agenda with some announcements and goes over some bullet points regarding old and new business. Then, he asks each person to give a status report on his or her projects. Each of us takes turns giving a quick rundown, while everyone else listens. Of course not everyone is paying attention, since they’re thinking about their own reports and what they plan to say. Sometimes our manager will make some comments or give us some feedback, but usually there’s very little discussion.
The meeting always ends the same way. Our manager gives a short summary of how our department is doing and a little pep talk to get us motivated. Now it’s back to our desks to do some work!

### Working at My Desk

When I get back to my desk, I clear off a few stacks of paper on the top of my desk so I have some space to work. I open the computer file I have been working on for the past week. This document is a report that is due next week and the deadline is fast approaching. I open my filing cabinet and take out two files and a manila envelope that has the information I need in them. I look around for the pad of paper I used to jot down
some ideas yesterday, and take out the paper clips, stapler, and Scotch tape I know I’ll also need. Now I have everything in front of me so I can get down to business. The first thing I have to do is get organized. I scan the information I have in front of me and take notes on the things I want to include in the report. Before I analyze the data for the report, I need to skim the background information to make sure I haven’t missed anything. I was making good progress but I’m feeling thirsty, so I decide to take a quick break.

### Taking a Break and Eating Lunch

I want to get some coffee, so I walk into the break room. My coworkers, Diana and Van, are standing next to the water cooler talking about a show on TV last night. I pick up the coffee pot and pour myself a mug of coffee. I am feeling really hungry, too, so I walk over to the vending machine. I’m looking over the candy bars and potato chips when Diana says, “We’re taking an early lunch. Do you want to join us?” I say, “Yes!” and the three of us walk across the street to a restaurant. I’m happy that we came early because we beat the rush. The hostess seats us
at a table and takes our drink orders. Our server comes over with our drinks and we place our food orders. I choose the lunch special and so does Diana. Van picks the all-you-can-eat soup and salad bar. While Diana and I wait for our orders to arrive, Van goes to the soup and salad bar and gets a really big plate of food. “Do you mind if I start?” he asks. “Of course not,” Diana and I say. When we finish eating, the server comes over to clear our plates and to give us our bill. We forgot to ask for separate checks so we all pay together. That was a good lunch. It was certainly better than the bag lunch I usually bring from home!

### Having Computer Problems

When we return to the office, I know I have to try to make some headway with my report. Unfortunately, as soon as I sit down in front of my computer, it starts acting up. First, my computer screen freezes and I have to boot it up again. Then, when I try to print a copy of my report, it won’t print. I discover that the problem is that the printer is jammed, so it takes some time to clear it and for it to work again. Finally, when I think that my computer worries are over, my mouse and keyboard go haywire. I finally give up and call the computer tech. I don’t usually like calling the computer tech to help me with computer problems. She’s nice enough, but she always makes me feel like I did something bad to my computer – something I shouldn’t have done – even when I haven’t. When she arrives, she sits down at my computer and asks me a lot of questions to find out what the problem might be. I tell her about the problems I had and she asks if I’d had any problems while working on my word processing program. I say that everything was fine, but I did have some trouble formatting one of my files and got an error message when working on my spreadsheet program. She starts doing something to my computer, typing on the keys a mile a minute for a long time. Finally she says, “Okay, it’s fixed. You shouldn’t have any more problems now – as long as you don’t abuse your computer.” Of course I never abuse my computer, but it’s no use telling her. At least my computer is fixed and I can keep working.

### Scheduling a Meeting

At 3 p.m., I get a call from one of our vendors who wants to set up a meeting for the following week. Since I was away from my desk at the time, she left a voicemail message. When I get back to my desk, I retrieve the message and listen to it, and then return her call. I call her twice, but she isn’t there, so I leave a voicemail message for her. We’re playing phone tag. Finally, at 4 p.m., she calls again and since I am at my desk, we can talk at last.
Andrea asks me if it is possible for us to meet early in the week next week. I check my calendar and I tell her that I’m tied up Monday and Tuesday, but that I’m free Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. She says that Wednesday afternoon suits her and asks what time would be good for me. I tell her the earlier the better, since I will be entertaining clients that night and need to leave work a little early that day. She suggests 1 p.m. I check my scheduled again to confirm that 1 p.m. Wednesday is free and clear and it is. She says that she will send me an email Wednesday morning as a reminder and I thank her. After all of that back and forth, we finally have a meeting set for next week.

### Meeting With the Boss

Before leaving work for the day, I want to stop by my boss’s office to give him an update on my progress. I know he’s expecting the report on Monday and I want to let him know that it will be finished on schedule.
Before I can do that, he calls me into his office and tells me to sit down. He tells me that the regional manager is impressed with my work and is considering me for a promotion. He says that this information is hush-hush, but he wants to give me the heads up. He says that the promotion would give me a new title and a small raise, but the most important thing is that it will put me in line to eventually become a regional manager myself. He praises me for my hard work and encourages me to keep my head down and to keep plugging away. I’m so surprised, I don’t know what to say. I’ve never thought of myself as a corporate climber and I didn’t think that my work was a standout from my coworkers’. Of course I thank my boss, shake hands with him, and leave his
office. It’s nice to get a pat on the back from him and I hope that the promotion does come through. I don’t want to jump the gun, though, so I’m not going to think about it too much in case it doesn’t happen.

### Leaving Work

I look at the clock and it’s already 5:30. It’s quitting time! I still need to put the finishing touches on my report, but I can do that on Monday morning before I submit it to my boss. Some weeks I have to take work home and burn the midnight oil, but not this week. I have everything under control and I don’t need to work over the weekend. I pack up my briefcase and shut down my computer. I put some important papers back in their folder and leave it in my desk drawer for safekeeping. I take the papers and files from my outbox and put them in my coworker’s inbox. But when I get back to my desk, another coworker has put some new memos and papers in my inbox! I like to clear my desk as much as possible at the end of the week to avoid clutter, and I guess everyone else does, too! I look at my desk one last time to make sure I haven’t left anything behind, and I’m ready to head home. Weekend, here I come!

### Socializing With Coworkers


When I walk past Van’s desk on my way out of the office, I see that he’s talking to a group of people. He stops and asks if I want to go with them to the happy hour at the restaurant and bar down the street. It has been a busy week and I need to blow off some steam. On top of that, I don’t have any big plans for the evening, so I say, “yes.” Eight of us walk down the street to Steve’s Cantina. We find a table in the back of the bar and look at the drinks menu. Happy hour is from 4 to 7 p.m., and the drinks are half price. We order our drinks and I go to get some snacks and appetizers. I look at the food that’s available and I see a lot of deep-fried foods and chips and dip, so I load up and go back to the table. One of the guys, Brian, starts to grumble about work and to bad-mouth the boss. I’m in no mood to talk about work, so I change the subject. I ask everybody what his or her plans are for the weekend. Diana says that she’s planning to kick back and relax. Rodrigo says he has a hot date. Van tells us a funny story about the last date he went on that didn’t go very well. We have a good laugh over it. We all have a great time at happy hour and it’s a good way to kick off the weekend!
