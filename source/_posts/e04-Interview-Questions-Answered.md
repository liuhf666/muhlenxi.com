## Tell me about yourself.

### Sample Answer 1

I have always enjoyed working with computers, so it was an easy decision to major in computer science at California University with a plan to enter the IT field. In school, I excelled in my computer-related classes and during my college years, I became particularly interested in software development, especially software that would help consumers. That’s why I applied for and completed a one-year internship with Lotadoe Industries. At Lotadoe, I learned how to formulate new ideas for software and how to communicate those ideas effectively to the rest of the development team.

I am a very focused person and I tend to be product-oriented. At Lotadoe, I made sure that whatever projects I worked on, I saw to completion. For instance, I worked with a team that was developing a new version of a piece of popular software called Rototype. I asked to be part of every step of software development and at the end of the project, I was given the responsibility of getting final technical approval. I made sure that I followed through with the right departments, keeping my team informed of the progress. This is the type of work I enjoy and that’s why I applied for a position with your company.

Your company is a leader in software development and is in the forefront of new ideas in the field. I think that the products your company has developed in the past several years have been outstanding and are the best on the market. I want to work in a company where I can be challenged and where I can make a contribution. I would very much enjoy working in your company to develop new software and to improve existing ones.

### Sample Answer 2

I have worked successfully in sales for over 10 years. One of my first sales jobs was in college, where I majored in business. I worked for the college newspaper selling advertising space, and as an extrovert who likes interacting with people, I was very successful in the job. What also helped me sell more than any other salesperson was my persistence. I was willing to follow up with a potential client over weeks and even months, developing a relationship with them until they were ready to make a deal with us.

I’m currently working as a sales rep for the Michmuney Company. I have been their top salesperson for the past two years. Last year, I sold over $3 million worth of products.

Now, I’m ready for a new challenge. I want to work in public relations because it is an area where I can use my creativity together with my knowledge of advertising and sales. I have a proven ability to work well with people and I can
develop good long-term relationships with clients. I want to work for your company in particular because you work primarily with Internet-based companies, which is an area that is growing at the rate of 40% a year. This makes your company a leader in the industry and I’d like to be part of that.

## Why did you leave your last job?

### Sample Answer 1

I’ve been with Lotadoe for over five years and I’ve enjoyed working there. I learned a lot about software development and how to work effectively with my colleagues.

About two years ago, I began getting interested in other aspects of design and started learning about new ways that the field is creating and developing new designs. I completed training that qualifies me to oversee other types of projects than the ones I work on now at Lotadoe. That’s why I’m now looking for a company that will allow me to more fully utilize my new skills and where I can take on new challenges. What I see in this position is also the opportunity for
growth and advancement. I think that my current skills and abilities are a good match with the current needs of this company.

### Sample Answer 2

The primary reason I left Michmuney Company was because the company went through a restructuring and my position was eliminated. Up to that point, however, I had a very good track record and received positive employee
evaluations each of the three years I worked there.

Leaving Michmuney actually allowed me to make a career change that I had been thinking about for some time and that is more aligned with my career goals. Although I’ve worked successfully in sales for the past several years, my
education and my interests are more closely related to marketing. I’d like to find a position that would allow me to use my knowledge and skills to do challenging work. This position would also give me more responsibility than I had at my last company and more promotion opportunities. I think that my skills and abilities are a good match for this job.

## Why do you want to work here?

### Sample Answer 1

This company is an industry leader and is at the forefront of exciting new developments in this field. Its mission to change the way consumers get and send information is, I believe, where the biggest areas of growth are in the
industry. Based on the company’s financials and its general performance in the past year, Lotadoe is poised to take over as one of the top suppliers of online service in the world. I have read about the company’s many future projects that are designed to move the company forward toward achieving its mission. I want to be part of this company because I believe I can be part of that growth.

In the past several years, I have led a number of innovative projects along the same lines as the current direction of this company. By doing this, I was able to help my current company get a foothold in the market. I’m confident that I can
bring my proven skills in management, development, and technology to succeed in your organization.

### Sample Answer 2

There are several reasons why I want to work for this company. First, I was impressed with the backgrounds of the founders and their vision for this company. Their innovative thinking is, I believe, in line with the best thinking in
the field right now. Your company also has one of the best reputations in the industry for innovative thinking and taking serious corporate responsibility for making a difference in the local communities.

As I learned more about the company and its growth potential, it became clear to me that I may be able to make a significant contribution to its goals. Since I have been working for the past five years as a successful marketing strategist, I believe I can bring those skills and the knowledge I’ve gained to help the organization reach its mission to become an industry leader.

I am now looking for a new challenge where I can take my proven skills and apply them to new situations, as well as learning new techniques to continue my own development. This is the company I've been looking for, a place where my background, experience, and skills can be put to use to make things happen.


## Where do you see yourself in five years?

### Sample Answer 1

My goal is that in five years, I will be working in a managerial position in this company. I see the next few years here at Lotadoe as an opportunity to gain the skills and knowledge to run one of the departments in this company. One of the
reasons I am applying for this position is that this is a large company with a lot of opportunities for advancement. If I continue working in the department where this position is, I hope to be a senior manager with a hand in shaping the
strategic plans for development in this area of technology. Another possibility in five years is to transfer to one of the regional offices, where I would oversee local operations.

Ultimately, the direction I would take in this company depends on many factors, such as the changing priorities of the market, the expertise I will have gained at the end of the five years, and the changing needs of the company. I have worn different hats in the company I’m working for now, and my flexibility has allowed me fill the needs of that company. I hope to have even more opportunities to learn and advance here at Lotadoe, and to contribute to its future
growth.

### Sample Answer 2

At the end of five years, I intend to be a leading expert in the field of marketing, working with some of the largest accounts in the country. That’s why I want to work for Michmuney. As a leader in the industry, Michmuney has the resources, talent, and the vision to be the best in the business.

Working for this company is an ambition for many people in this field, and I’m no different. If I’m hired, I plan to cultivate new accounts in industries that Michmuney has not yet explored, including the automotive and healthcare fields. By doing this, I hope to break new ground for this company and to expand its influence in the marketplace.

I see being here at this company long term, not only to continue to build my expertise, but to influence the direction that this company will take in the next ten years. I could do this in any number of official roles in the company, such as
managing a region or heading one of the main offices.

I’ve had the opportunity to work all over the country, but I consider this city my home. Working with Michmuney would allow me to come back to my hometown, where I’d plan to stay for a long time. I can’t think of a better place to call my
new professional home than Michmuney.

## What are your strengths?

### Sample Answer 1

As you can see from my resume, I’ve taken advantage of every opportunity to complete training to develop technical knowledge in this field. Now I’m considered an expert in the technologies that my current company is working on.
Last year, when the company decided to expand in this area, the management selected me to head the new project.

To head this team effectively, I used my planning skills to make sure that the team was on task and on time, at all times. My management skills came in handy to get the most out of each person on the team. For instance, two of the
team members came from competing departments. I work with both of them closely and entrusted them with the most important part of the project. This way, I was able to develop trust between these two team members. This resulted in
producing excellent work, while forming one of the most sought-after partnerships in the company.

Because this was a new initiative, the nature of the job changed as the project developed. Another one of my strengths is that I’m flexible and I’m able to handle change in the company or in my job responsibilities. When I started on
this project, we had four team members. By the end, we had 16. That means that I needed to go from working one-on-one with each team member to having to delegate responsibility as the project grew. This was possible because of the
trust I had built up within the team and my ability to shift gears when the project changed over time.

### Sample Answer 2

One of my biggest strengths is my communication skills. In my current job, I work with people from all over the world and many different backgrounds. I’m able to understand that everyone has different perspectives about projects and
work tasks.

One of our most recent hires comes from a developing country. It’s very tempting when talking about the latest technological developments to dismiss or at least ignore her perspective. However, as the head of the department, it was clear to me that this new employee brought a fresh perspective on why we needed to consider different options when deciding on the type of technology to adopt. Through hard work and determination, I was able to get the rest of the department to make important changes that moved us in the same direction as the project.

I was fortunate that I was able to develop these analytical skills when I was an undergraduate student at McQuillan University. The program I was in used casebased teaching so that we worked on solving real-life problems under real-life conditions. I graduated at the top of my class, and now, I make use of the skills I learned there everyday.

## What are your weaknesses?

### Sample Answer 1 

A weakness that I have is that I don’t like to do public speaking and I get nervous when I have to give a presentation or a speech in front of other people. I realize that I won’t need to do any public speaking in this job right now, but I want
to overcome this fear so that when the time comes, I’ll be prepared. It’s important to me to identify any shortcomings that may affect my job performance or career advancement opportunities, and to do something about them.

To combat my fear of public speaking, I took a public speaking class at Litton College a few months ago, and after I finished the course, I joined a Toastmaster club. I have been going to the club meetings regularly where I give speeches in front of other members and I get constructive criticism about my performance.

I can say that in the past five months, I have become a better and more confident speaker. I think, however, I can be even better, and that’s why I’ve continued to attend meetings and to look for opportunities to put into practice what I’ve learned. I’m confident that in a very short time, I’ll be an even better and more effective speaker and presenter.

### Sample Answer 2 

When I started my first job, I had trouble with procrastination. Even though I never missed a deadline, I found that procrastinating put me under unnecessary stress, and this hurt my enjoyment of the job. Fortunately, I realized the problem fairly quickly and did something about it.

The first thing I did was to talk to my colleagues about how they managed their time effectively. I learned that many of them used project management software, which I also began to use. This type of program allowed me to set deadlines and benchmarks for the different tasks I had to do, and gave me reminders about how far along I should be on a given task. This helped with my planning and has made me more organized overall. Now, I use this type of planning for all of my major job tasks, and procrastination is no longer a problem for me.
