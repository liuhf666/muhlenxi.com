## Lesson 1 – Starting a Meeting

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

On behalf of Vision Corporation, I’d like to call this meeting to order. This is a meeting of some of the key players in our company: our top managers. Our purpose this morning is to hear a presentation about a new initiative for outreach and marketing, and to discuss this plan with all of you.

This is a presentation that all of us have looked forward to. This initiative marks a new milestone in the evolution of our company. First, it serves as an assessment of where our company is now in terms of communicating its message to its customers domestically and abroad. Furthermore, this plan has the potential to drive our company forward by transforming our corporate outreach and marketing strategies.
We are delighted that all of the major contributors to this initiative are here today. They will use their unique perspectives to talk about the current state of affairs in terms of outreach and marketing, give details about the new proposed initiative, and outline the path for implementation.

### Meeting B - Informal Meeting

Okay, everybody. Please take a seat. Let’s get started. I’ve called this meeting of our top salespeople so that all of you get a chance to hear about the new plan to get our company out there in order to reach more of our potential market. First, we’ll hear a presentation from the team that has been working on this. Then, we’ll discuss it to get your feedback and put our heads together to see if there are any other ideas.
While the team is getting set up, let me say a few words. What does this new plan mean for our company? First, it’s a reality check on where we are right now in terms of getting our message to our customers. Second, this plan has the potential to move the company forward. One of our main challenges, as you all know, is staying relevant in this changing market. Today’s presentation has some really innovative ideas about how we can do this.

## Lesson 2 – Introducing the Participants

### Meeting A – Formal Meeting

Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to introduce the participants who have graciously agreed to share their time with ustoday. I believe that all of you already know me, Alex Aurora, the CEO of Vision Corporation.
On my immediate right is Ms. Hannah Graff, the account representative from our marketing consulting firm. She has been a visionary leader in coordinating the focus groups and helping us identify our target market.
On my far right, the gentleman in the gray suit is Mr. Chris Banda, who is the Senior Vice President of Product Development. Over the past few months, he has shown great flexibility and willingness to adapt his product features to better meet our customers’ needs.
And last but not least, I’d like to introduce our Senior Vice President of Marketing, Mr. Shawn Edwards. He has been coordinating our marketing efforts for the past seven years, and his hard work is culminating in today’s presentation.
With that, I’ll turn it over to our Senior Vice President of Marketing, Shawn Edwards, who will lead the proceedings today. Thank you to all of you for being here, and welcome.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

Before we dive into the presentation, I should probably start by saying that I’m Alex Aurora, the CEO of Vision Corporation, just in case there’s anyone here who hasn’t met me in person before today. Could I please get our key team members to introduce themselves? Hannah, why don’t we start with you?

Sure. I’m Hannah Graff, an account representative from the marketing firm that has been doing the focus groups. Today I’ll betalking about your target market. It’s my pleasure to join all of you today.

I’m Christopher Hanson, the Senior V.P. of Product Development. I’ve been tweaking our product so that it’s a better fit for what our customers are looking for.

Hi, everybody. I’m Shawn Edwards, Senior V.P. of Marketing. I’ve spent the past few months trying to keep up with all the great work that Hannah and Chris have been doing.

Great, thanks. Now I’m going to turn it over to Shawn who’ll be running the show today.

## Lesson 3 – Beginning a Presentation

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Thank you, Alex. And thank you to everyone who is here today. As you know, today’s presentation is designed to present ourrecommendations about how Vision Corporation can increase its market share by reaching more of its potential market.

You should each have a copy of our handouts in front of you that correspond to the slides up here on the screen. This first slide shows our agenda for the day.

First, I will begin with an overview of how our market share has been declining during the past twelve months, and the reasons for that decline. Then, Ms. Graff will present the data that she gathered from the focus groups and her ideas for clarifying our target market. She will be followed by Mr. Hanson, who will discuss adapting our product to meet market needs, and he’ll conclude with our main recommendations.

Since we have limited time today, please hold your questions until the end of the presentation.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

All right, let me start by saying thanks to all of you for your interest in this presentation. Does everyone have the printed handouts? Great. Let’s start by taking a look at what we’re going to cover today.

As you can see in this outline here, we’ll start off by talking about how our market share has been falling over the past year, and the reasons why. After that, Hannah’s going to tell you about the focus groups she conducted and what we can learn from them. She’ll also share her ideas about who our target market really should be. We’ll finish off with Chris talking about how his team has been able to change our product so that it has more appeal to our customers. Then he’ll wrap things up with our team’s recommendations.

Any questions so far? If you have questions later on during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

## Lesson 4 – Giving a Presentation: Part A

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

As I mentioned, our market share has been sliding for the past year. Naturally, Vision Corporation is alarmed by these changes and wants to understand the underlying reasons. The truth is, we’re not entirely sure why we’re losing market share, but we have identified three factors that may contribute to the cause: a growing number of competitors, our product’s features, and poor advertising.

First, the number of competitors in our industry has doubled in the past year. To counter this, we must learn to differentiate Vision Corporation from the other companies. Second, our product lacks some of the features that customers are looking for. We need to improve our product and make it the best market offering. Third, our We need to rethink our marketing campaigns and make sure that we’re targeting the right market.

Now I’m going to turn things over to Ms. Graff, who will discuss the findings of her focus groups.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

As I said a moment ago, our market share has taken a nosedive in the last year. Why? We think it’s a combination of three things: (one) there’s a lot more competition now than there was a year ago, (two) our product isn’t meeting the needs of the market, and (three) our advertising is speaking to the wrong customers. These are some pretty serious but not insurmountable problems, so let’s take a look at the solutions we’ve come up with.

First, we’re facing twice as many competitors as we were a year ago, so we need to make sure that customers know that Vision Corp. is the best in the business. Second, we need to make sure that our product has all the bells and whistles that our customers have come to expect. And third, we have to revamp our marketing efforts and make sure that our ads appeal to the right group of customers.

Hannah, can you please take over now and tell us what you learned from the focus groups?

## Lesson 5 – Giving a Presentation: Part B (Visuals)

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Thank you, Mr. Edwards. We conducted eight focus groups, each with 10 to 12 people who currently use the product. In this pie chart, the yellow-shaded area represents those participants who buy the product from Vision Corporation, and they comprise only 13% of thepeople we spoke with. That’s consistent with Vision Corporation’s market share segment.

We asked the participants what features they wanted when purchasing the product and this table shows their answers in descending order of importance. As you can see across this row and down this column, Vision Corporation’s current product offering includes only one of the top three most desired features.

Finally, we asked the participants to rank the product offered by Vision Corporation against those of the top four competitors, and the results are shown in this bar chart. Vision Corporation received the best rankings for “affordability,” but suffered in all the other categories. This line graph shows that these figures have held steady over the four months we’ve conducted these focus groups. We believe this means that your company would be justified in raising the price of its product and using the additional revenue to improve the product’s features.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

Thanks, Shawn. Each of the eight focus groups we spoke with had 10 to 12 participants who are users of the product, although not necessarily the one offered by Vision Corp. In this table, you can seethat the proportion of people who use your company’s product compared to the total market is fairly small, at only 13%. This, of course, means your competitors have a big leg up on the market with over 85%.

We asked participants what kinds of things they look for when deciding which product to buy. Let me walk you through this chart with my laser pointer. You can see that the most important features are listed alphabetically under the header, “Important Features.” Unfortunately, your current product has only one of three most sought-after features.

That may be one important reason why more customers aren’t buying your product.

Finally, take a look at this bar chart, which shows how your product’s features stack up against those of your competitors. Your product has good “affordability,” but the truth is that your customers aren’t thatconcerned about price. You could easily raise your prices and use the extra money from sales to better match your product with what customers are looking for.

## Lesson 6 – Ending a Presentation

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Using all of the information that Ms. Graff has just presented as a starting point, my product development team has been trying to enhance our product to include more of customer’s desired features.Our specific proposals were described in detail in the memo that was circulated last week, so I see no reason to cover them in depth at this point in time. However, we do need to open a dialogue about which changes we’re going to implement, and a timeline for doing so.

So, as our presentation concludes, I want to repeat the key points. First, our market share is showing a downward trend. Second, our marketing campaign isn’t appropriate for our target audience. Third,many key features are missing from our product. Our recommendations are to revamp our marketing campaign and redesign our product. We are facing some serious problems, and we need your input in order to deal with them as quickly as possible.

Without further ado, I’d like to open the floor for discussion. Shawn will be our moderator.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

Our product development team has been busy trying to synthesize all the data that Hannah has just presented in order to create a better product for our customers. We sent out a memo last week that described our specific ideas, and based on all the signatures on the routing slip, it looks like most of you have already seen it, so I won’t repeat everything. In a minute, we’re going to ask you to help us brainstorm even more ideas.

Before you get your creative juices flowing, let’s just briefly recap the main points of this presentation. Our market share has taken a beating and we’re missing the mark with our marketing and our product. To tackle these problems, we recommend creating a better marketing campaign and creating a new version of our product. We’re asking for your best ideas during the discussion. Shawn, will you take the helm?

## Lesson 7 –Managing a Discussion

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

When you have a question, please raise your hand. This will allow me to call on people one at a time and avoid having people talk over each other. Also please make sure that your questions are on topic. Who would like to begin?

I need to voice my concern about how the focus groups were not asked about color or design. I think this would have….

Please pardon my interruption, but with all due respect, Mr. Hanson, I completely disagree with you. I understand your concern, but in our experience those product characteristics pale in comparison next to “affordability” and “ease of use.” I don’t have time to address your concern fully, but most customers aren’t interested in design as much.

If I may offer my opinion, I believe Mr. Hanson has a legitimate concern and I’m glad he asked that question, but Ms. Graff may be right about the importance of listening to our customers. However, this topic is outside the scope of my expertise.


### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

Let’s get this show on the road. This is an open discussion, so who wants to start off?

Hannah, even though I’ve been knee-deep in your data for months, there’s something I have to get off my chest. Why didn’t you ask the focus groups about our product’s color and design?

I can see your point, Chris, but based on past experience, we know that customers mostly consider “affordability” and “ease of use” when deciding which product to buy. I can’t go into this in detail now, but most customers just want reliability, and the design is secondary.

Chris, you’ve brought up an interesting point, but I think Hannah is right. Don’t take this the wrong way, Chris, but the interests of engineers and our customers aren’t the same. But of course, I’m not a marketing expert by any means.

## Lesson 8 – Taking Questions

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Mr. Hanson, was Ms. Graff able to allay your concern? Good. Now we have time for only two more questions. Ms. Graff?
My question is for Mr. Hanson. I was wondering whether you could expand on the section regarding product design. Am I correct in assuming that you want to offer the product in more colors?Let me see if I can shed better light on that. Although colors may not be as important to consumers, we are of the opinion that having more variety will increase sales….Is that the only reason?Please let me finish my thought. Another reason, which may be beyond the scope of your question, is that the increase in our costs will be small. Have I answered your question?Yes, certainly, Chris. You’ve made it clear for all of us. And now for our final question. Mr. Aurora?Given the growing competition, is it possible for us to drop this product and move into a different market? Can you speak to the implications this would have on our strategy?We did consider that option, but we quickly dismissed it. We believe that we should stick to our core competencies and improve the product we currently have.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

I’m afraid we’re running out of time. Let’s take two more questions.Let me jump in with a question for Chris. Chris, I think your memo hit the nail on the head. But let me play devil’s advocate for a minute. Our focus groups weren’t very interested in design. Why are you suggesting that we offer the product in more colors?

I can see your point, but we think that having more colors will raise sales at least a little bit. And we can do it very inexpensively.Oh, I see. That clears things up for me. Thanks.Alex, did you have your hand up?I did. Thanks, Shawn. What I’d like to know is whether your team has thought about developing an entirely new product and entering a different market.Yes, we have, but we’ve ruled it out for now. We think it’s best to use our company’s strengths and improve our current product, rather than creating something new.

## Lesson 9 – Ending a Topic / Planning for the Future

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Unfortunately, our time together is drawing to a close and we won’t be able to take any more questions today. I have been very favorably impressed by today’s discussion, but a great deal of work remains to be done.
I propose that we form two committees to focus on the major outstanding issues. Ms. Graff, I would like you to head the first committee, which is charged with developing a new marketing campaign that will help us reach our target market. Mr. Hanson, you will be the chairperson of the second committee, which will begin making the proposed product changes ASAP.
I would also like to establish a regular meeting schedule so that we can convene and have the committees report back to the larger group about their progress. If this time slot is convenient for everyone, I propose that we meet at this time every Tuesday for the next two months. At that point, we can reevaluate our situation and determine whether we would like to continue with the meetings.

### Meeting B – Informal Meeting

We’re almost out of time, so we need to end our question-andanswer session. I think we’re heading down the right path with today’s discussion, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us.
For us to move ahead with these changes, we’ll need to create two committees: one for our new marketing campaign, and one for improving our product. Hannah and Chris, I’d like you to be in charge of each of these committees.
It will be important for everyone to get together regularly so that we can monitor the committees’ progress. Let’s plan on meeting once a week. Does this time on Tuesday work for everyone? Let’s try it for two months and then we can make a decision as to whether we’d like to continue meeting so frequently.

## Lesson 10 – Ending a Meeting

### Meeting A - Formal Meeting

Shawn, on behalf of all the attendees, I want to thank you for leading such an interesting and productive meeting. I think we have all learned something here today and we have a clear action plan for the next steps.
Our secretary will type up the minutes for today’s meeting and we’ll distribute them via email for comments. She will also reserve a conference room for next Tuesday’s meeting and you’ll be apprised of the location as soon as we know it.
Please sign your names on this sheet of paper before leaving today, so that we’ll have a record of who was at today’s meeting. Our secretary will type up a list with your contact information, and we’ll disseminate the participant list to all of you.
For now, I’m adjourning this meeting. We will see each other again next Tuesday. Thank you to all of you for your participation.

### Meeting B - Informal Meeting

Shawn, thank you for organizing this meeting. We all appreciate you telling us about the work that your team has done. The new committees have a lot on their plate over the coming weeks and months.
Our secretary will send an email with the minutes for today’s meeting. Please read them and let us know if you have any corrections or additions. She’ll also try to find us a meeting space for next Tuesday and she’ll send a reminder with that info a few days before the meeting.
Before you leave, I’m passing around this list with contact information for all of you. Please check off your name once you’ve double-checked that it’s correct. You’ll get a copy of this list within a few days so that we can all keep in touch between meetings.
Okay, everybody. That’s a wrap. Thanks for your attention. See you on Tuesday.
